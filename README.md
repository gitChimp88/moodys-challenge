# Moodys challenge

## Decisions

I decided to use Ant design as a component library as it has a lot of options for components and will allow me to move fast with this challenge, it also has pagination out of the box which is something I will need to implement anyway for performance, a little customisation is lost with styling and I may have to code my own filter depending on how the in built one performs.
